Hotels and residences across the UAE Capital have been advised to lift their restrictions on beach swimming and sea activities, originally enforced after **two orcas, also known as killer whales, were spotted off the coastline of Abu Dhabi on Tuesday, May 9.**

Over the past two days, some establishments were asked to ban guests from entering the sea, while others even closed their beaches completely.

However, in an email issued by Abu Dhabi’s Department of Culture and Tourism (DCT) and obtained by Khaleej Times, hotel operators are now permitted to resume sea activities under the proviso that they follow strict guidelines.

“Swimming activities may resume in your respective establishment’s beach with several recommendations,” the email read.
